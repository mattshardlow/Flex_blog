                Being an External Examiner

        <div class="content">
            <h2 id="What"><a href="#What" class="headerlink" title="What?"></a>What?</h2><p>In 2019, I was asked by a former colleague at a local university to participate in a PhD oral transfer examination as an external examiner. The PhD student had completed the first 18 months of study and was required to undertake an examination to determine whether he was allowed to continue with his studies or not. Although I had previously worked with the supervisor, I had never met the student before. In preparation for this examination, the student had compiled a transfer report covering their progress so far, documenting their literature review and some initial experiments that had been undertaken as part of his research. </p>
<p>The examination panel consisted of myself as the external examiner, the student’s supervisor as internal examiner and a chair who was an academic from another faculty at the student’s university. My role in the examination was to read the transfer report prior to the viva and come up with a set of questions. In the examination, which was time-limited to 75 minutes, I was given free rein to ask these questions. After the examination, I discussed the student’s progress with the internal and the chair and made my recommendation on the student’s outcome. An excerpt of the questions I prepared and asked are below:</p>
<ul>
<li>General Questions<ul>
<li>Who is your main competition in this research?</li>
<li>What specific challenges does your topic area present?</li>
<li>What are your main intended research contributions?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Specific Questions<ul>
<li>Why does undersampling improve performance?</li>
<li>What train-test protocol did you use for your experiments?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the examination, the student presented his work and then responded to questions. I had some concerns from reading the student’s transfer report that the amount of work that had been completed was insufficient, and the amount of work that was proposed would not be enough to gain a PhD classification. I asked the student about this, framing my question around the contributions that they expected to make to the scientific discourse. Whilst it was clear that the student had a high-level understanding of the subject area, they did not have a deep understanding of some of the key elements of the subject area they were working on. Our decision was to ask the student to revise and resubmit their work, pending a final decision on their progression. I wrote formative feedback for the student to consider. The re-examination has not yet taken place.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="So-What"><a href="#So-What" class="headerlink" title="So What?"></a>So What?</h2><p>Prior to this, I have never been in the role of an external examiner (Although I have completed internal examinations at MMU and helped to prepare fellow PhD students for examination).  It was enlightening to be in the examiner’s chair and I was able to better understand the context surrounding examination. In the work of Kumar and Stracke (2011), it is argued that the role of the PhD examiner bridges both summative assessment and formative feedback, with both being equally valuable. This was very apparent to me in my role as external, where it was key to give a summative judgment on the student’s ability to progress into the rest of their PhD, but also to give feedback to the student to help them understand where they were failing and what needed to be done to rectify their situation and allow them to progress. My hope is that at the re-examination, I will find that the student has taken on board the feedback that I gave him and will use this to develop his PhD.</p>
<p>I have also considered whether I was right for the role of external examiner in this context. Joyner (2003) argues that selecting the right external examiner is vital to ensure that the student is assessed fairly and robustly. Accordingly, the selection process should weigh up the examiner’s domain expertise against their humanity. Domain expertise ensures that the examiner is capable of asking probing questions that will expose any weaknesses in the student’s understanding. Humanity ensures that the examiner will listen to the student and give fair consideration to their responses. </p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Now-What"><a href="#Now-What" class="headerlink" title="Now What?"></a>Now What?</h2><p>As a prospective PhD supervisor, I would like to be in a position where I can take on new students and submit them for examination. When I do so I will consider two things:</p>
<h3 id="1-How-to-select-an-examiner"><a href="#1-How-to-select-an-examiner" class="headerlink" title="1. How to select an examiner"></a>1. How to select an examiner</h3><p>I will look into examiners that are domain experts, as I can see it is very important to have an examiner in the room who understands the context of the work that is being undertaken. I will also take into account the humanity of an examiner, leveraging my existing contacts or personal recommendations to ensure that an examiner who is considerate of the student’s needs is chosen.</p>
<h3 id="2-How-to-prepare-a-student-for-examination"><a href="#2-How-to-prepare-a-student-for-examination" class="headerlink" title="2. How to prepare a student for examination"></a>2. How to prepare a student for examination</h3><p>I was struck by the student’s lack of preparation. If it had been my own PhD candidate I would have run a mock examination with them prior to the real thing and used that to give them feedback that they could have incorporated into the examination, allowing them to pass first time. </p>

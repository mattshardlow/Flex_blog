            <h2 id="What"><a href="#What" class="headerlink" title="What?"></a>What?</h2><p>In the final session of the programming bootcamp (see previous post), I integrated a piece of academic research into my teaching. This post explores the implications of research informed teaching in an HE setting.</p>
<p>As a research informed practitioner, I expect my students to understand that programming is more than just learning to write code. Instead it is learning to apply the skills involved in writing code to solve problems. Problem solving is an essential research skill across any discipline and it is also essential to learning to program. By teaching the students to problem solve, I am enculturing them in my research. There are, of course, clear mutual benefits in training students to be active researchers. First and foremost, it gives me the opportunity to talk about my research in my lectures. My hope is that by doing this, I will encourage others to become interested in my field and study to Masters’ and PhD level upon completion of their undergraduate. Secondly, my students are apprentices, which means that they are working on real world problems in industry. Giving them an opportunity to understand my research means that I may have a chance to work with them in a professional context on industry problems. </p>
<p>In the final session of the bootcamp, I designed a research informed lecture and lab session. I framed this around a piece of software called ELIZA (Weizenbaum, 66). ELIZA is the original chatbot, designed in 1966 as a proof of concept for text based interaction with a computer. ELIZA revolutionised the way people thought about Human computer interaction and spawned a family of related applications that allowed users to talk to computers. Something which we consider common place in the age of Siri, Alexa and Google Home. I chose this piece of research for 3 reasons. 1) It is similar to my field of interest, building off of many natural language processing principles, ELIZA transforms user’s input into sensible responses. 2) It is familiar to the students. Everybody has heard of a chatbot, so by teaching them about something they already know, it overcomes some of their fear. 3) It was an attainable goal to teach them. I didn’t have to teach them any new programming skills to understand the code that they were looking at.</p>
<p>In the ELIZA lecture I first showed them an interaction with ELIZA. I then talked about the research paper that ELIZA was based on and talked them through the key principles of ELIZA and how it transforms a user’s input into responses. Finally, I talked them through the coding principles needed to create ELIZA. up to this point, our programmes had been very short (5-10 lines), which meant that ELIZA (at around 20 lines) would be the longest programme they had seen. I showed them every line of code that they would need and explained its function in the context of previous examples that they had worked on.</p>
<p>After the lecture I set a lab exercise for the students in which they were first given all the code that we had used in the lecture. They then had a few simple exercises in which they had to edit parts of the code to alter and extend the behaviour of the programme. This ensured that the students read and understood the original code-base before they started to edit it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="So-What"><a href="#So-What" class="headerlink" title="So What?"></a>So What?</h2><p>The students enjoyed working with ELIZA. I had many people comment that they found it interesting to work with a larger code base, and that they enjoyed seeing the principles that we had covered in class used in a larger exercise with real world applications.</p>
<p>This type of research informed, as opposed to evidence based (Lingard and Renshaw, 2013), teaching is vital in the HE sector, where academics maintain an active research profile. At university, we must teach at the cutting edge of practice in order to turn out high quality graduates who understand the capabilities and limitations of a field. Further, we expect students to be future leaders in their chosen fields, including those who choose an academic career path. It is vitally important, therefore, to embed research into teaching to help students learn research based skills, which will help in their future careers.</p>
<p>According to Burgum and Stoakes (2016) (writing online for the HEA blog), research informed practice can take one of four forms. </p>
<ol>
<li>Research led teaching sees students being taught research findings from their field.</li>
<li>Research oriented teaching informs students of research methodologies likely to be used in their field.</li>
<li>Research tutored teaching encourages students to read and critique literature from their domain</li>
<li>Finally, Research-based learning sees the student as a researcher, immersing them in a research environment.</li>
</ol>
<p>In my teaching, I am keen to integrate all of these elements of research informed teaching. The session I have described corresponds well to ‘research led’ teaching, as I have directly instructed the students on the paper in question.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Now-What"><a href="#Now-What" class="headerlink" title="Now What?"></a>Now What?</h2><p>I am keen to integrate more research into my teaching practice. It is very helpful to consider the four different types of research informed teaching outlined by the HEA, I will consider how to design sessions around each of these over the next year. I am aware that not all students want to gain a deep understanding of programming, especially if they are not working on programming in a professional capacity. I will consider how to integrate research-informed teaching in a way that allows those at the top end of the class to interact with it, whilst also allowing those at the bottom end to learn from it.</p>

            <h2 id="What"><a href="#What" class="headerlink" title="What?"></a>What?</h2><p>In Septemeber 2019 I ran a coding Bootcamp as part of the induction week for Level 4 Degree Apprentices on the Digital and Technology Solutions Degree Apprenticeship. Degree Apprenticeships are the Government’s flagship apprenticeship model offering a ‘earn while you learn’ experience. Apprentices work in a professional role for an employer and are released one day per week to university. The students undertake 90 credits a year for four years, earning a BSc (hons) degree classification. Although I usually have the students one day a week, I have them for a full week before the start of term (called induction week). In this week, they participate in administrative activities (welcome talks, orientation, Moodle, etc.) on the Monday and Tuesday. On the Wednesday they then begin the programming bootcamp. This is a 3-day intensive workshop where I teach them some of the basic concepts of programming. I assume no prior knowledge of programming as a course prerequisite and so I teach accordingly. The workshop is structured as a lecture-lab format, with one hour lectures in which a key programming skill is taught and then a 1.5 hour lab in which the students have an assessed exercise to complete that practices the skill they have learnt. There are 5 lecture sessions and 6 labs, one each morning and afternoon with the exception of Friday afternoon when an extended lab session is delviered to allow students to complete any work from previous sessions.</p>
<p>The students are typically widely varied in their abilities coming in to the course. In the first lecture I asked them to do a mini-survey to assess their capabilities. I found that most had heard of at least one programming language, and many of them had already learnt some basic programming skills. I also asked them to state how many years of work experience they had. I discoveed that whilst a third of the course had never worked before (coming on to the course straight from college), around 40% had between 1 and 5 years of work experience with the remaining 25% having worked for over 5 years. This shows a real diversity in the experiences of people on the course.</p>
<p>On the first day of the bootcamp, I covered very basic programming concepts, asking the students to copy a basic programme from the slide and run it. I also asked them to complete some exercises that didn’t require them to write any code, with the aim being that they would feel eased in to programming. I ensured that wach lab session has 2 helpers and I moved between labs to assess student’s progress and try to identify any struggling students. The second day I introduced some further coding concepts as well as new lab exercises. These lab exercises required some more thinking from the students and were not always obvious in how the concepts they had been taught related to the task they were asked to do. For the advanced students I also added challenge exercises into the labs, which encouraged them to further their understanding of the conepts that we had been using. </p>
<p>On the final day, I designed a session that integrated my research interests with my teaching. I will speak about this further in my final blog post.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="So-What"><a href="#So-What" class="headerlink" title="So What?"></a>So What?</h2><p>Programming is an applied skill. Similar to learning to drive, or learning a musical instrument, it is not enough to simply teach the theory. Practive is key. Bloom’s taxonomy (Bloom et al. 56) famously states that learning happens in stages. Learning to program requires not only the lower order elements identified by Bloom (Remember, understand), but also higher order elements such as the ability to apply concepts in new situations and later to create using the building blocks that have been learnt.  To encourage the development of these skills, I attempt to embed real world problems in lectures and labs, encouraging the students to participate in both active learning (Huxham 05) and deep learning (Marton and Salio 05). Teaching programming naturally lends itself to a constructivist approach to learning and teachng (King 93), where learners are creators in their own right and must take an active part in their learning to ensure that they gain the full benefit. promoting life-ling learning (Knapper and Cropley 00). </p>
<p>After the bootcamp I ran a qualitative feedback survey which asked the students 2 yes or no questions: Whether they felt the bootcamp was beneficial? and whether the bootcamp helped them feel more confident in their programming abilities? 94% of participants responded yes to the first question and 91% responded yes to the second. I was very pleased with these scores as they indicate that many of the students took something away from the bootcamp. Both those who had some programming experience already and those who did not.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Now-What"><a href="#Now-What" class="headerlink" title="Now What?"></a>Now What?</h2><p>Teaching programming to a mixed group is infamously difficult. Some students feel like the course is moving too slow, whereas others feel they are being left behind. Caving to either of these ends of the spectrum will leave the other feeling exasperated. Most students fall somewhere in the middle on this spectrum. They are able to do some of it, but not all. The only way forward is to aim the material at those in the middle. The top students will always finish early and the bottom end will always struggle. For those at the top end I will assign extra challenges throughout the year to help them stretch their understanding further. For those at the bottom end, I will continue to offer support within and outside of sessions as well as giving them extra resources to learn for themselves where possible.</p>

                Being an External Examiner

        <div class="post-info">
            
                <span class="date">2019-09-04</span>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 id="What"><a href="#What" class="headerlink" title="What?"></a>What?</h2><p>In 2019, I was asked by a former colleague at a local university to participate in a PhD oral transfer examination as an external examiner. The PhD student had completed the first 18 months of study and was required to undertake an examination to determine whether he was allowed to continue with his studies or not. Although I had previously worked with the supervisor, I had never met the student before. In preparation for this examination, the student had compiled a transfer report covering their progress so far, documenting their literature review and some initial experiments that had been undertaken as part of his research. </p>
<p>The examination panel consisted of myself as the external examiner, the student’s supervisor as internal examiner and a chair who was an academic from another faculty at the student’s university. My role in the examination was to read the transfer report prior to the viva and come up with a set of questions. In the examination, which was time-limited to 75 minutes, I was given free rein to ask these questions. After the examination, I discussed the student’s progress with the internal and the chair and made my recommendation on the student’s outcome. An excerpt of the questions I prepared and asked are below:</p>
<ul>
<li>General Questions<ul>
<li>Who is your main competition in this research?</li>
<li>What specific challenges does your topic area present?</li>
<li>What are your main intended research contributions?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Specific Questions<ul>
<li>Why does undersampling improve performance?</li>
<li>What train-test protocol did you use for your experiments?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the examination, the student presented his work and then responded to questions. I had some concerns from reading the student’s transfer report that the amount of work that had been completed was insufficient, and the amount of work that was proposed would not be enough to gain a PhD classification. I asked the student about this, framing my question around the contributions that they expected to make to the scientific discourse. Whilst it was clear that the student had a high-level understanding of the subject area, they did not have a deep understanding of some of the key elements of the subject area they were working on. Our decision was to ask the student to revise and resubmit their work, pending a final decision on their progression. I wrote formative feedback for the student to consider. The re-examination has not yet taken place.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="So-What"><a href="#So-What" class="headerlink" title="So What?"></a>So What?</h2><p>Prior to this, I have never been in the role of an external examiner (Although I have completed internal examinations at MMU and helped to prepare fellow PhD students for examination).  It was enlightening to be in the examiner’s chair and I was able to better understand the context surrounding examination. In the work of Kumar and Stracke (2011), it is argued that the role of the PhD examiner bridges both summative assessment and formative feedback, with both being equally valuable. This was very apparent to me in my role as external, where it was key to give a summative judgment on the student’s ability to progress into the rest of their PhD, but also to give feedback to the student to help them understand where they were failing and what needed to be done to rectify their situation and allow them to progress. My hope is that at the re-examination, I will find that the student has taken on board the feedback that I gave him and will use this to develop his PhD.</p>
<p>I have also considered whether I was right for the role of external examiner in this context. Joyner (2003) argues that selecting the right external examiner is vital to ensure that the student is assessed fairly and robustly. Accordingly, the selection process should weigh up the examiner’s domain expertise against their humanity. Domain expertise ensures that the examiner is capable of asking probing questions that will expose any weaknesses in the student’s understanding. Humanity ensures that the examiner will listen to the student and give fair consideration to their responses. </p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Now-What"><a href="#Now-What" class="headerlink" title="Now What?"></a>Now What?</h2><p>As a prospective PhD supervisor, I would like to be in a position where I can take on new students and submit them for examination. When I do so I will consider two things:</p>
<h3 id="1-How-to-select-an-examiner"><a href="#1-How-to-select-an-examiner" class="headerlink" title="1. How to select an examiner"></a>1. How to select an examiner</h3><p>I will look into examiners that are domain experts, as I can see it is very important to have an examiner in the room who understands the context of the work that is being undertaken. I will also take into account the humanity of an examiner, leveraging my existing contacts or personal recommendations to ensure that an examiner who is considerate of the student’s needs is chosen.</p>
<h3 id="2-How-to-prepare-a-student-for-examination"><a href="#2-How-to-prepare-a-student-for-examination" class="headerlink" title="2. How to prepare a student for examination"></a>2. How to prepare a student for examination</h3><p>I was struck by the student’s lack of preparation. If it had been my own PhD candidate I would have run a mock examination with them prior to the real thing and used that to give them feedback that they could have incorporated into the examination, allowing them to pass first time. </p>

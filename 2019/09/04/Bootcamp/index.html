        <h1 id="What"><a href="#What" class="headerlink" title="What?"></a>What?</h1><p>In Septemeber 2019 I ran a coding Bootcamp as part of the induction week for Level 4 Degree Apprentices on the Digital and Technology Solutions Degree Apprenticeship. Degree Apprenticeships are the Government’s flagship apprenticeship model offering a ‘earn while you learn’ experience. Apprentices work in a professional role for an employer and are released one day per week to university. The students undertake 90 credits a year for four years, earning a BSc (hons) degree classification. Although I usually have the students one day a week, I have them for a full week before the start of term (called induction week). In this week, they participate in administrative activities (welcome talks, orientation, Moodle, etc.) on the Monday and Tuesday. On the Wednesday they then begin the programming bootcamp. This is a 3-day intensive workshop where I teach them some of the basic concepts of programming. I assume no prior knowledge of programming as a course prerequisite and so I teach accordingly. The workshop is structured as a lecture-lab format, with one hour lectures in which a key programming skill is taught and then a 1.5 hour lab in which the students have an assessed exercise to complete that practices the skill they have learnt. There are 5 lecture sessions and 6 labs, one each morning and afternoon with the exception of Friday afternoon when an extended lab session is delviered to allow students to complete any work from previous sessions.</p>
<p>The students are typically widely varied in their abilities coming in to the course. In the first lecture I asked them to do a mini-survey to assess their capabilities. I found that most had heard of at least one programming language, and many of them had already learnt some basic programming skills. I also asked them to state how many years of work experience they had. I discoveed that whilst a third of the course had never worked before (coming on to the course straight from college), around 40% had between 1 and 5 years of work experience with the remaining 25% having worked for over 5 years. This shows a real diversity in the experiences of people on the course.</p>
<p>On the first day of the bootcamp, I covered very basic programming concepts, asking the students to copy a basic programme from the slide and run it. I also asked them to complete some exercises that didn’t require them to write any code, with the aim being that they would feel eased in to programming. I ensured that wach lab session has 2 helpers and I moved between labs to assess student’s progress and try to identify any struggling students. The second day I introduced some further coding concepts as well as new lab exercises. These lab exercises required some more thinking from the students and were not always obvious in how the concepts they had been taught related to the task they were asked to do. For the advanced students I also added challenge exercises into the labs, which encouraged them to further their understanding of the conepts that we had been using. </p>
<p>On the final day, I designed a session that integrated my research interests with my teaching. I will speak about this further in my final blog post.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="So-What"><a href="#So-What" class="headerlink" title="So What?"></a>So What?</h1><p>Programming is an applied skill. Similar to learning to drive, or learning a musical instrument, it is not enough to simply teach the theory. Practive is key. Bloom’s taxonomy (Bloom et al. 56) famously states that learning happens in stages. Learning to program requires not only the lower order elements identified by Bloom (Remember, understand), but also higher order elements such as the ability to apply concepts in new situations and later to create using the building blocks that have been learnt.  To encourage the development of these skills, I attempt to embed real world problems in lectures and labs, encouraging the students to participate in both active learning (Huxham 05) and deep learning (Marton and Salio 05). Teaching programming naturally lends itself to a constructivist approach to learning and teachng (King 93), where learners are creators in their own right and must take an active part in their learning to ensure that they gain the full benefit. promoting life-ling learning (Knapper and Cropley 00). </p>
<p>After the bootcamp I ran a qualitative feedback survey which asked the students 2 yes or no questions: Whether they felt the bootcamp was beneficial? and whether the bootcamp helped them feel more confident in their programming abilities? 94% of participants responded yes to the first question and 91% responded yes to the second. I was very pleased with these scores as they indicate that many of the students took something away from the bootcamp. Both those who had some programming experience already and those who did not.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="Now-What"><a href="#Now-What" class="headerlink" title="Now What?"></a>Now What?</h1><p>Teaching programming to a mixed group is infamously difficult. Some students feel like the course is moving too slow, whereas others feel they are being left behind. Caving to either of these ends of the spectrum will leave the other feeling exasperated. Most students fall somewhere in the middle on this spectrum. They are able to do some of it, but not all. The only way forward is to aim the material at those in the middle. The top students will always finish early and the bottom end will always struggle. For those at the top end I will assign extra challenges throughout the year to help them stretch their understanding further. For those at the bottom end, I will continue to offer support within and outside of sessions as well as giving them extra resources to learn for themselves where possible.</p>
